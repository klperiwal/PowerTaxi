### Existing Problem:
Travelling in Cabs is still considered unsafe in many parts of India, especially when it's night or the Ladies and Children are traveling alone in the cab. Ola and Uber are used widely, not because they are safe  but no other option is available with them.

### Proposed Solution:
- Better hiring process for drivers: Training and Testing (Both physical & mental) procedures for application as a driver
- A particular emphasis on promoting female drivers will be given. 
- Also the ex-Army Officers and Trained NCC candidates are to be chosen which ensures complete protection of the passengers.
- Better monitoring of cabs: Installing a CCTV inside the cab to monitor, Realtime Location tracking, and supervision by our team.
- Emergency buttons are present both in the cab and the app.


### Unique Selling Proposition (USP) of the Product:
The main USP of the product is our Well trained and tested drivers. They either belong to Indian Armed Forces or from NCC/ Scouts and have been tested regularly both 
mentally and psychologically. This ensures a complete safety package for the rider.

**Why OLA and UBER Cannot Compete with Our Model:**

1. **Financial Instability Post-Pandemic**: Both OLA and UBER have faced significant financial setbacks due to the pandemic, with their average driver salaries stagnating at around â‚¹15,000, often disbursed after three months or more. This financial strain limits their ability to innovate and improve driver conditions.

2. **Driver-Owned Vehicles**: Unlike our integrated approach, both OLA and UBER rely on drivers individually purchasing their vehicles, merely offering a platform to connect passengers with drivers. This model inherently limits their control over service quality and vehicle standards.

3. **High Sunk Costs**: Together, OLA and UBER have already invested approximately $194 million in their existing infrastructure and business model. This substantial investment makes it nearly impossible for them to pivot or overhaul their business strategy at this stage.

4. **Lack of Driver Background Checks**: Both companies have minimal oversight on driver backgrounds, requiring only a driving license and a well-equipped cab. With a combined driver base of around 2.5 million in India, implementing stringent background checks now would risk losing a significant portion of their market, thereby damaging their market credibility.

Our model addresses these gaps by ensuring financial stability for drivers, maintaining strict control over vehicle standards, and implementing comprehensive background checks, setting us apart in the ride-hailing industry.
