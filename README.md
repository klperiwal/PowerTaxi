Problem: Travelling in Cabs is still considered unsafe in many parts of India, especially when its night or the Ladies and Children are travelling alone in the cab. Ola and Uber are used, but they arent completely safe either.

Proposed Solution:
- Better hiring process for drivers: Training and Testing (Both physically & mentally) procedures for application as a driver
- A special emphasis to promote female drivers will be given. 
- Also the ex Army Officers and Trained NCC candidates to be chosen which ensures complete protection of the passengers.
- Better monitoring of cabs: Installing a CCTV inside the cab to monitor, Realtime Location tracking and supervison by or team.
- Emergency buttons present both in cab and the app.

The main USP of the product is our Well trained and tested drivers. They either belong to Indian Armed forces or from NCC/ Scouts and are been tested regularly both 
mentally and psychologically. This ensures a complete safety package for the rider.
