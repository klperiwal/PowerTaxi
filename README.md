Problem: Travelling in Cabs is still considered unsafe in many parts of India, especially when it's night or the Ladies and Children are traveling alone in the cab. Ola and Uber are used, but they aren't completely safe either.

Proposed Solution:
- Better hiring process for drivers: Training and Testing (Both physical & mental) procedures for application as a driver
- A particular emphasis on promoting female drivers will be given. 
- Also the ex-Army Officers and Trained NCC candidates are to be chosen which ensures complete protection of the passengers.
- Better monitoring of cabs: Installing a CCTV inside the cab to monitor, Realtime Location tracking, and supervision by our team.
- Emergency buttons are present both in the cab and the app.

The main USP of the product is our Well trained and tested drivers. They either belong to Indian Armed Forces or from NCC/ Scouts and have been tested regularly both 
mentally and psychologically. This ensures a complete safety package for the rider.
